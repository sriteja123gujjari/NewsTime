                <p>On Monday evening, Allu Arjun took to his X handle and shared a new poster of Pushpa 2: The Rule. It featured him in his titular role of Pushpa Raj, wearing a grey t-shirt, a brown shirt over it, with a matching bandana on his head. He held a sword in his hand, resting threateningly on his shoulder. Allu looked into the camera, sporting a deadly expression. His caption stated, “#Pushpa2TheRule in cinemas from December 6th, 2024.”</p>
